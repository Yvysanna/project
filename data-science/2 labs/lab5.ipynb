    "In the next exercises we are going to read and use a structured dataset `happiness` which corresponds to Happiness World Report 2022. You can find more info about the meaning of each column in the dataset [here](https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2022/#appendices-and-data). Importantly, *Life Ladder* corresponds to the happiness index. In this lab all the different tools you have been introduced to in the previous labs can be very useful and may be useful as reference when doing the exercises."
