# OOP crash course

When building ABMs, it is very useful to make use of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm. We will shortly introduce you to what OOP is, en how you can apply it in Python. For this, you will get a OOP crash course, for which you can find all the material [here](https://github.com/minprog/project/blob/2022/abm/oop_crashcourse/BOOP_met_de_royals.zip?raw=true).

Do not worry if it is not clear instantly, it usually takes a while before OOP completely makes sense! In the coming exercises, we will start applying OOP, and it will automatically become more clear.
