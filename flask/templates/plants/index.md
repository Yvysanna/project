# Template: Plants

Most classrooms at Lab42 are a bit barren, much like our own. In years prior we added quite a number of plants, but it took the effort of dedicated plant loving teaching assistants and students to keep them going. Especially over such things as summer holidays! In more recent years we asked students to bring in their own plants, BYOP if you will. This worked wonders, but as the students went, so did the plants. Then came Corona. What followed was a mass plant relocation event. After which it has never been the same.

While introducing plants is relatively easy, maintenance in this setting is not. With many varieties of plants and many potential caretakers there is a constant risk of both under and over watering at the same time. Try to solve this problem by introducing a caretaker web-app.

### Requirements

Create a web-app for managing plants in our classrooms of Lab42.

* Create an overview for all the plants.
* Have calls to action for upkeep related tasks.
* Enable users to manage plants by performing routine maintenance tasks, but also adding and removing plants.
* Introduce traceability, who has done what and when.
* Realize that users are imperfect and allow for correction in plant upkeep. 

### Challenges

This app introduces a virtual setting that is set to track a real life situation over time. To keep everything in sync you are relying on users. This creates noise you will have to deal with. How do you ensure plants are not swimming in water thanks to forgetfullness of a user to register watering that day?  

Theory of upkeep will likely not match practice. For instance, some schedules of watering might not be practical or match the actual needs of a plant. How do you let users tweak and adjust schedules? 

You are dealing with many potential maintainers that will likely need a little nudge to do the work, but also clear instructions on what to do. How do you motivate others to take action?

Especially in this setting, users are not perfect and will misremember, not register what they have done, or wake up screaming in the middle of the night realizing they forgot to register watering that one plant. Be sure to think ahead and allow for flexibility. For instance, what do you do if an hour later you suddenly remember you had to register watering?
