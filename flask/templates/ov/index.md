# Template: Public Transport

Unless you are one of the lucky few to be able to cycle to Science Park, odds are you are taking public transportation. This means you are doing some mental arithmetic each to day figure out good times to leave the classroom. You are probably opening an app to check train and/or bus times, even if just for potential delays. Perhaps checking a weather app to see if you might want to leave early or a little later. And then soms maths of distance/time to get to the actual station. Plus it's not just you, many of those around you are doing the exact same thing every day. Let's improve this experience and make public transport information from Lab42 accessible and visible.

### Requirements

Create a web-app for OV options from Lab 42.

* Include at least two different modes of transportation.
* Create a live view of available options.
* Incorporate live weather data.
* Allow users to customize their routes.

### Challenges

You will be working with different sources of live data. This requires you to interact with various APIs and to frequently update your data. In doing so, you will likely find limitations of these APIs such as rate limits. This requires some creative thinking to get around.

Everything is live and that means your pages should realistically be as well. This challenges you with creating a truly dynamic web app. Perhaps a bit more so than other project, you will have to work with a bit more JavaScript.
