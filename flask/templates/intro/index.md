# Proposal

This course has been around a while and as you can imagine, we have seen quite a number of projects. Here is what we have learned from the most succesful projects:

* Choose a topic that is interesting and/or important to you. If you have an affinity with something, or you have that one problem that you are itching to solve, chase that and go do it. Technical constraints are secondary here, and we love to think with you on how to make your idea a reality.
* Keep your eye on the prize. Know the problem you are trying to solve and who you are solving it for. The better you are able to define this, the better will your project and overall experience be.
* A smaller project is much better than an oversized unfinished project. Time is limited and there will always be more to do, but it is usually more rewarding to go back and make what is there the best it can be.

The course is generally structured around these ideas. First, we will ask you to draw up a proposal. The core of which is you explaining what you are trying to solve, why you want to do this, who it's for, what you need to build and how. Once submitted, you will meet with one of the staff to discuss. During which you can expect a little pushback from us. The intent is to get the core of the project down to a clear elevator pitch, and to clearly define what parts will be there at course's end.

Next, you will be working on the project iteratively. This means building towards a tiny working version of your project as quickly as possible, and iteratively improving from there. We have framed this as different releases, but more on that later. 

### Choosing a topic

Below you will find several project templates. These templates contain ideas and requirements for projects that we think are fun, challenging and generally well-scoped. If one of these templates or ideas appeals to you, do feel encouraged to take up the challenge and make that project. Note that the templates provide general direction, it is ultimately up to you to decide what the actual project is going to be and how it is all going to work. 

* [Lunch](/flask/templates/lunch)
* [Public Transport](/flask/templates/ov)
* [Meeting](/flask/templates/meeting)
* [Plants](/flask/templates/plants)
* [Benches](/flask/templates/benches)

Outside of these templates, you are **free to choose your own topic for a project**. The only ask is that you **talk to one of the staff as early as possible**. Preferably well before the proposal deadline!
