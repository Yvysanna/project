# Template: Benches

Amsterdam has a large number of public benches, but they are relatively hard to discover. There is no real way to find a bench near you, other than walking around or asking around. Odds are that the benches you find are taken and if free, they are probably not in the best spot. Inspired by [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amsterdam/comments/x4x19o/waar_is_je_chillste_bankje/) and Stephen Adai's project in 2022, let's change this and make it easy to find a good place to sit.

### Requirements

Create a web-app for finding public benches in and around Amsterdam*.

* Enable users to find a bench near their location.
* Create a system to review benches.
* Allow for adding and removing benches.
* Make it easy to find your way to a nearby bench.

> *You are free to focus on other cities or broader regions than Amsterdam, but it might prove harder to get initial data.

### Challenges

A large part of this project revolves around working with location data. Both that of the user of the app and any potential benches. Odds are you would want to work with external APIs for route planning and maps.

Data might be somewhat hard to come by. There is the Reddit thread for interesting spots, and openstreetmaps.org can provide a lot of location data. But ultimately you need to put it all together.

Users can make this app come to life by providing feedback and such things as images or details about each bench. For that to happen users need to interact with the app. Think about systems to encourage users to interact, to actually want to leave feedback.
