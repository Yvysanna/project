# Template: Meeting

At the start of every semester we have a few weeks of slight social awkwardness. During those weeks it is generally a little too quiet in the classrooms. This naturally changes as time progresses and students and TAs get to know each other. But even then, there are often not too many activities organized. As it takes a student or two with quite some organizational skills to truly get things off the ground. This means that in a semester of just twenty weeks, things go by fast and towards semester's end there is often this general wish to have done a little more. So, let's change this and build a solution to plan and hold social meetings for such things as quick coffee breaks to beach volleybal tournaments.

### Requirements

Create a web-app for meetings at Lab 42.

* Allow users to pitch new meetings.
* Make meetings easily discoverable for others.
* Create an interesting method to manage and discuss meeting requirements such as time/place.

### Challenges

This app is primarily about users. The content is user-driven and the focus is on participation. This means you will be managing a considerable amount of user data and any potential user error. For instance, how do you prevent multiple meetings on the same thing at the same time?

Planning requires a little coordination and adjustability. Perhaps someone is going to be a little later and maybe that is okay, but still useful to know. Or perhaps it'd be best to move the meeting all together. How do you get this kind of information from users and how do you let users tweak meetings?

Not all users are equal in this project. You will be dealing with several roles and different permissions in various parts of the web app. For instance, you would not want anyone to be able to change or even unschedule just any event.
