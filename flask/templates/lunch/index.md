# Template: Lunch

Let's face it, Science Park's main cafetaria isn't all that. But, there are quite a number of other options located in and around Science Park that do offer a good or actually affordable lunch. Sadly these are often not discovered within the semester that students spend at the minor programming. This is the problem you are going to try to solve, make lunch options discoverable for others.

### Requirements

Create a web-app for all the different lunch options @ Science Park.

* Include at least three different places on Science Park.
* Have a system in place for updating or retrieving changes to lunch options.
* Enable meaningful user interaction through reviews and/or ratings. 

### Challenges

You will be working with changing data from various sources. This means you are tasked with some creative data processing. How do you get the info you need, how do you store, and how do you keep it up to date?  Think carefully about what your users want to know, and what you'd want to know!

Try to prevent analysis paralysis as much as possible. Once you start to include more and more options, odds are the whole system becomes much less usable and less inviting to (new) users. Try to come up with systems to get users the information they want, without overloading them with choice.

Harvest user feedback to better help the user itself and other users. This is where your app can truly add value over static pages of menu options. But it's not easy to get users to interact with your app. Counter this and try to make it quick and easy for a user to capture their experience with any given option.
