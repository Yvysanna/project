# Lecture 2: HTML & CSS

> This is an optional lecture covering topics such as web protocols, HTML and CSS. If you have previously taken the course "Datarepresentaties, tools en technieken" you have already seen all of these topics and can safely skip this lecture. Do feel free to peek at the notes or use parts of the lecture as a quick refresher.

> Note that towards the end of the lecture Brian covers SASS. This is an extension of CSS that added several powerful features. However, over time these features have been added to the standard of CSS itself. This is why we will no longer be using SASS within this course.
